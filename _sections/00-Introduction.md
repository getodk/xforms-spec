The ODK XForms specification is a subset of the far larger [XForms 1.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/). It contains a few additional features not found in the XForms specification.

This specification continues to evolve. On the web you will often see references to _JavaRosa_ and _OpenRosa_ when the spec is discussed. OpenRosa was the name of the initial specification that formed the basis of this document. JavaRosa is a library that implements the XForms part of the OpenRosa specification.

The document assumes at least a fair understanding of XML and XPath. It is also useful to refer to [XForms 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xforms-20031014/) for details about shared features.
